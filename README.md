# Web-Scrapping-NCAA-BB
In this project, I scrapped the NCAA website and created a dataset for the 2021 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball

The final dataset is NCAA_BBStat_df and the jupyter notebook used to create the final dataset is called D1_NCAA_MBB_WebScrapping-Final. The other datasets NCAA_Stat (145, 146, 168) are datasets  of the specific stats that were scrapped in order to help create the final dataset.
